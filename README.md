# KBCExperimentPlaform
Knowledge base completion experiment platform. Any one can change experiment data set (must KB like), or implement your own model (especially Embedding-based model).

Tips:
a) In this project, System.err is used to print instant information, which is for monitoring the processing or schedule of the running of algorithm. On other hand, System.out is used to print results or others you want to remain, amd usually it should be redirected to file stream.
